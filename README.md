This project was created as part of the UX design course. All models are created in Maya, textures are created using Substance Painter. 
The room is a rectangular room with cabinets for storing and quickly finding information.
There is a paper shredder on the left side of the room. In the middle there are filing cabinets. 
On the right is a paper trolley, which contains new folders with information and those folders that you need to use.
The main goal of the project is a more accurate understanding of what should be the UX design: colors, sizes of objects, their location relative to the camera. 
Also an important part of the project is the using of prompts for the user in the form of labels and buttons.
